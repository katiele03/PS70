# Final Project Idea: Booming Battle Board 🚢💥

---

## Traditional Battleship

- Each player has two grids in front of them:
  - **Own board** → ships are placed and marked when hit  
  - **Tracking board** → tracks opponent’s coordinates attacked
- Players take turns calling out coordinates to attack  
- A ship is **sunk** when all its cells are hit  
- Goal: sink all opponent’s ships

## My Twist on Battleship 

A two-player Battleship board with **LED feedback and sensors**.  
Instead of calling out coordinates, players tap directly on their grid.  
- Lights up **red** for “hit”  
- Lights up **white** for “miss”  
- Plays sound effects

## 3D Design and Fabrication
- **Laser cutting** → engraved coordinate plates + frosted LED tiles  
- **3D printing** → ships + board casing  

---

## Electronics (Input / Output)

**Inputs**  
- Ship detection  
  - Magnets + Hall sensors  
  - Conductive foil + capacitive pads  
- Capacitive touch grid → detects tapped cells  

**Outputs**  
- RGB LEDs under each tile  
  - 🔴 Red = hit opponent’s ship  
  - ⚪ White = miss  
  - 🟢 Green = ship on own board  
- Sounds  
  - 💥 Explosion = hit  
  - 💦 Splash = miss  

---

## Microcontroller Programming
- Detects when a player taps a tile  
- Detects when a ship is present  
- Turns LEDs on/off  
- Plays sounds
