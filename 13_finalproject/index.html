<h3>Final Project Idea 1: Booming Battle Board 🚢💥 </h3>


</div>
### Traditional Battleship

- A two player game where each player has two grids in front of them:
  - their own board, where their ships varying in sizes on the grid horizontally or vertically are placed and where they mark when they’ve been hit  
  - their tracking board, where they mark the coordinates they’ve attacked their opponent  
- The two players take turn “attacking” each other’s ships by picking coordinates where they think the other player has placed their ships  
- The objective of the game is to sink your opponent’s ships  
- If the ship lies in the cell/coordinate, it is a hit  
- If the ship does not lie in the cell/coordinate, it is a miss  
- A ship is sunk when all cells the ship lies in has been hit  
- Players keep track of the cells that are called on the grid in front of them
