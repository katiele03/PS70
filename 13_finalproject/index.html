# Final Project Idea: Booming Battle Board 🚢💥

---

### Traditional Battleship

- A two player game where each player has two grids in front of them:  
  - **Own board** – where their ships are placed, marked when they’ve been hit  
  - **Tracking board** – where they mark coordinates they’ve attacked  
- Players take turns attacking by picking coordinates  
- Objective: sink all of the opponent’s ships  
- If the ship lies in the chosen coordinate → it’s a **hit**  
- If not → it’s a **miss**  
- A ship is sunk when all its cells are hit  
- Players keep track of called cells on their grid

</div>

### My Twist on Battleship 

A two-player Battleship board with **LED feedback** and **sensors**!  
Instead of calling out coordinates, players physically tap the grid:  

- Board lights up **red** for “hit”  
- Board lights up **white** for “miss”  
- Sound effects for immersion

### 3D Design and Fabrication  
- Laser cutting: create grid plates with engraved coordinates + frosted LED tiles  
- 3D printing: ships and casing for board grids  

---

### Electronics (Input and Output)

**Inputs:**  
- Ship detection:  
  - Magnetic → embed magnets in ships + Hall sensors under tiles  
  - Conductive → foil in ships + capacitive pads under tiles  
- Capacitive touch grid → detects tapped cells  

**Outputs:**  
- RGB LEDs under each tile:  
  - 🔴 Red = hit opponent’s ship  
  - ⚪ White = miss  
  - 🟢 Green = ship on own board  
- Sounds:  
  - 💥 Explosion = hit  
  - 💦 Splash = miss  

---

### Microcontroller Programming  
- Detects when a tile is tapped  
- Detects when a ship is present  
- Turns LEDs on/off  
- Plays sounds
