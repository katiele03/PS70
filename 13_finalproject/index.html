# Final Project Idea: Booming Battle Board üö¢üí•

### Traditional Battleship

- A two player game where each player has two grids in front of them:
  - their own board, where their ships varying in sizes on the grid horizontally or vertically are placed and where they mark when they‚Äôve been hit  
  - their tracking board, where they mark the coordinates they‚Äôve attacked their opponent  
- The two players take turn ‚Äúattacking‚Äù each other‚Äôs ships by picking coordinates where they think the other player has placed their ships  
- The objective of the game is to sink your opponent‚Äôs ships  
- If the ship lies in the cell/coordinate, it is a hit  
- If the ship does not lie in the cell/coordinate, it is a miss  
- A ship is sunk when all cells the ship lies in has been hit  
- Players keep track of the cells that are called on the grid in front of them

</div>

### My Twist on Battleship 

A two-player Battleship board with LED feedback and sensors! Instead of calling out coordinates to sink a ship, you can physically tap coordinates on your grid. This causes the board to light up red for ‚Äúhit‚Äù or white for ‚Äúmiss‚Äù with sound effects.

### 3D design and fabrication (mold/cast, 3D print, lasercut, etc.)
- Laser cutting: create grid plates with engraved coordinates and frosted tiles for LEDs
- 3D printing: 3D print ships and encasing for board grids

### Electronics (input and output)
- Inputs:
  - Ship detection:
    - Magnetic detection: embed magnets in ships and place Hall effect sensors under each tile
    - Conductive detection: embed conductive foil in ships so that capacitive pads under grid tiles can sense when a ship is there
  - Capacitive touch grid: detects when a cell is tapped so user can attack opponent 
- Outputs:
  - RGB LEDs placed under each tile
    - red = hit opponent's ship
    - white = miss opponent's ship
    - green = ship is on grid (on own player's baord)
  - Sound 
    - explosion/boom = hit opponent's ship
    - splash = miss opponent's ship

### Microcontroller programming
- will be used to detect when player taps a tile
- detects when a ship is present on a tile 
- turn on and off LEDs
- play sound
