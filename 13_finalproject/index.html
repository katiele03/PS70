  <section class="my-5">
    <h3>Traditional Battleship</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A two player game where each player has two grids in front of them:
        <ul>
          <li>their own board, where their ships varying in sizes on the grid horizontally or vertically are placed and where they mark when they‚Äôve been hit</li>
          <li>their tracking board, where they mark the coordinates they‚Äôve attacked their opponent</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The two players take turn ‚Äúattacking‚Äù each other‚Äôs ships by picking coordinates where they think the other player has placed their ships</li>
      <li>The objective of the game is to sink your opponent‚Äôs ships</li>
      <li>If the ship lies in the cell/coordinate, it is a hit</li>
      <li>If the ship does not lie in the cell/coordinate, it is a miss</li>
      <li>A ship is sunk when all cells the ship lies in has been hit</li>
      <li>Players keep track of the cells that are called on the grid in front of them</li>
    </ul>

  <!-- My Twist -->
  <section class="my-5 text-center">
    <h3>My Twist on Battleship</h3>
    <p>
      A two-player Battleship board with LED feedback and sensors! Instead of calling out coordinates to sink a ship, you can physically tap coordinates on your grid. This causes the board to light up red for ‚Äúhit‚Äù or white for ‚Äúmiss‚Äù with sound effects.

  <!-- 3D Design -->
  <section class="my-5">
    <h3>3D design and fabrication (mold/cast, 3D print, lasercut, etc.)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Laser cutting: create grid plates with engraved coordinates and frosted tiles for LEDs</li>
      <li>3D printing: 3D print ships and encasing for board grids</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Electronics -->
  <section class="my-5">
    <h3>Electronics (input and output)</h3>
    <h5>Inputs:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Ship detection:
        <ul>
          <li>Magnetic detection: embed magnets in ships and place Hall effect sensors under each tile</li>
          <li>Conductive detection: embed conductive foil in ships so that capacitive pads under grid tiles can sense when a ship is there</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Capacitive touch grid: detects when a cell is tapped so user can attack opponent</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Outputs:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>RGB LEDs placed under each tile
        <ul>
          <li>red = hit opponent's ship</li>
          <li>white = miss opponent's ship</li>
          <li>green = ship is on grid (on own player's board)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Sound
        <ul>
          <li>explosion/boom = hit opponent's ship</li>
          <li>splash = miss opponent's ship</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Microcontroller -->
  <section class="my-5">
    <h3>Microcontroller programming</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>will be used to detect when player taps a tile</li>
      <li>detects when a ship is present on a tile</li>
      <li>turn on and off LEDs</li>
      <li>play sound</li>
    </ul>
