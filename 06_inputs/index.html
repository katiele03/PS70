<h3>Week 6: Electronic Inputs</h3>

<h4>Assignment: Sensors and Calibration</h4>

<p>
For this week’s assignment, I worked with electronic input devices by building and calibrating two different sensors: a capacitive touch sensor and an ultrasonic distance sensor. The goal of this week was to understand how raw sensor signals behave, how they vary with user interaction or distance, and how to calibrate these signals for meaningful interpretation.
</p>

<h4>Capacitive Sensor</h4>
<p>
I first built a capacitive sensor designed to measure changes in capacitance at a sensing electrode. The sensor outputs raw ADC values that vary depending on the amount of conductive material in proximity to the electrode. An image of my capacitive sensor setup and the corresponding sensor schematic are shown below.

<p>
To calibrate the capacitive sensor, I recorded ADC values over time while interacting with the sensing surface using different levels of contact. The five calibration stages were no contact, hovering my finger over the sensor, lightly pressing on the sensor, firmly pressing on the sensor, and full palm contact.
</p>

<p>
Looking at the plotted data below, the baseline readings with no contact ranged from approximately 840–850. As contact with the sensor increased, the ADC values decreased monotonically, eventually reaching values in the range of 0–20 during full palm contact. Some variation is present in the data, which is expected since the applied pressure and contact area are subjective and not perfectly repeatable.

<h4>Ultrasonic Distance Sensor</h4>
<p>
For my second sensor, I used an ultrasonic distance sensor to measure the separation between the sensor and a piece of cardboard. An image of the ultrasonic sensor setup and its schematic are shown below.

<p>
I calibrated the ultrasonic sensor by recording distance values over time at known separations between the sensor and the cardboard. The five calibration distances were 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 mm. These measurements were taken by positioning the cardboard at specific ruler ticks in front of the sensor.
</p>

<p>
The plot below shows that the measured distance values cluster around the expected distances. As the separation between the sensor and the cardboard decreases, the reported ultrasonic distance correspondingly decreases. Some variation is present in the data due to manual movement of the cardboard along the ruler ticks and slight alignment changes during measurement.

<h4>Additional Work</h4>
<p>
In addition to sensor calibration, I also prepared a CAD file for next week’s assignment. I plan to fabricate a frame for my friend’s birthday gift. The design and fabrication process will be documented on the following week’s page.
</p>

<h4>Song Choice</h4>
<p>
I chose this song because light is a type of sensor, and I enjoy Ellie Goulding’s music.
