    <h1>Creating Kinetic Sculpture</h1>
    <div class="content-section">
      <p>
        For my kinetic sculpture, I wanted to create a planetary gear system with myself at the center. This idea came about during an interaction with my mom who I want to thank for providing the inspiration for my project. One Monday, I was calling my mom (as a good daughter does) and she did not answer my call. This got me thinking what could she possibly be doing. Her only occupation is being my mom (besides her actual job). She responds a few minutes later. I obviously give her a difficult time for not responding immediately. She basically said that the world does not revolve around me. Her claim got me thinking. Are you sure it doesnâ€™t? This project is evidence that it actually does.
