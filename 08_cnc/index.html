For this week’s assignment, I wanted to create a gift for my friend’s birthday. For the first part of the assignment and for my friend’s gift, I decided to gift her a picture frame with an image of us. Since her favorite flowers are tulips and daises, I wanted to create a 4x6 picture frame with a tulip and daisy design on the border of the frame.

I first sketched the picture frame on Fusion 360. The outside border of the frame is 6x8 and it fits a 4x6 picture. Then, I sketched tulips and daisies on the border. Here is the final sketch of the dxf I used and a video of a model of the frame.

I then picked two pieces of wood, one for the actual frame and the other to be the sacrificial piece. I measured the thickness of the frame wood piece. Then, I used a nail gun to insure the wood pieces do not move during CNCing. Here is a video of me using a nail gun for the first time.

I imported my file into the CNC software and defined the toolpaths, including which areas needed to be removed, the cut depths, and the XYZ origin. I then applied the appropriate feed and speed rates. Because the tulip and daisy designs were very thin, I chose to use the smallest end mill available. Here is a video of that setup process.

After generating the toolpaths, I performed an air cut to confirm that the milling stayed within the boundaries of the wood. Once I saw the air cut stayed within bounds, I re-zeroed all axes and began the actual cut on the wood piece. Here are videos of zeroing the machine and the milling process.

After the frame was cut out, I cleaned the wooden debris using the vacuum and sanded down my wooden frame. Here are videos of this process.

For the second part of the assignment regarding molding and casting, I collaborated with Kieran McDaniel. Please refer to his documentation page at this link:
